# fend-weather-journal-app
Asynchronous web app that uses API calls and user data to dynamically update the UI for an Open Weather Map journal app.

## Getting Started

This app requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) to run a local express server, but once you have downloaded Node, you've done most of the work! Download or clone this repo (like so)

```
git clone https://github.com/paulmreese/fend-weather-journal-app
```

then navigate to the directory and use the command

```
npm install
```

to download all required project dependencies. Now, you can start the server with the command

```
node server.js
```

You should receive a confirmatory log on the command line that the app is listening!

Now, all you need to do is navigate to the ip address in your browser(If you've already started your server, as in the last step, [then it will be this link](http://localhost:3000)), and you should see the application running:

```
http://localhost:3000
```
